#Hybrid Image
this is a python script that performs image processing on two grayscale images of a cat and a dog, and then creates a hybrid image by blending the processed versions of these two images.
this script demonstrates the creation of hybrid images by applying low-pass and high-pass filtering in the frequency domain to emphasize different frequency components in two input images (cat and dog). The final hybrid image combines both low and high-frequency information, resulting in an image that exhibits different visual characteristics depending on the viewing distance.
